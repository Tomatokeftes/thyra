## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- Poetry for dependency management
- Git

### Setup Steps

1. **Fork and Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Thyra.git
   cd Thyra
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Install Pre-commit Hooks** (Recommended)
   ```bash
   poetry run pre-commit install
   ```

4. **Verify Installation**
   ```bash
   poetry run pytest -m "not integration"
   ```

## Code Style Guidelines

We use automated tools to maintain consistent code style:

### Formatting
- **Black** for code formatting
- **isort** for import sorting
- Line length: 88 characters (Black default)

### Linting
- **flake8** for code linting
- **bandit** for security checks

### Type Hints
- Use type hints for all public functions
- Follow PEP 484 conventions

### Running Code Quality Checks

```bash
# Format code
poetry run black .
poetry run isort .

# Run linting
poetry run flake8

# Run security checks
poetry run bandit -r thyra/
```

## Testing Requirements

### Test Types

1. **Unit Tests** - Fast tests for individual functions
   ```bash
   poetry run pytest -m "unit"
   ```

2. **Integration Tests** - End-to-end workflow tests
   ```bash
   poetry run pytest -m "integration"
   ```

### Test Coverage

- Aim for >80% code coverage for new code
- Run tests with coverage:
  ```bash
  poetry run pytest --cov=thyra --cov-report=html
  ```

### Writing Tests

- Place unit tests in `tests/unit/`
- Place integration tests in `tests/integration/`
- Use descriptive test names: `test_should_convert_imzml_when_valid_file_provided`
- Mark tests appropriately: `@pytest.mark.unit` or `@pytest.mark.integration`

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Create a Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**
   - Follow code style guidelines
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation if needed

3. **Run Quality Checks**
   ```bash
   poetry run black .
   poetry run isort .
   poetry run flake8
   poetry run pytest
   ```

4. **Commit Your Changes**
   - Use clear, descriptive commit messages
   - Follow conventional commit format when possible:
     ```
     feat: add dry-run mode for conversion preview
     fix: resolve memory leak in large dataset processing
     docs: update installation instructions
     ```

### Submitting the Pull Request

1. **Push Your Branch**
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Open a Pull Request**
   - Use the provided PR template
   - Fill out all sections completely
   - Link related issues

3. **Respond to Review Feedback**
   - Address all reviewer comments
   - Make requested changes promptly
   - Ask questions if feedback is unclear

## Issue Reporting Guidelines

### Before Opening an Issue

1. **Check Existing Issues** - Search for similar issues first
2. **Reproduce the Problem** - Ensure you can consistently reproduce the issue
3. **Gather Information** - Collect relevant system info, error messages, and sample data (if shareable)

### Issue Types

Use the appropriate issue template:

- **Bug Report** - For reporting software defects
- **Feature Request** - For suggesting new functionality
- **Question** - For general questions about usage

### Information to Include

**For Bug Reports:**
- Operating system and version
- Python version
- Thyra version
- Input file format and size (if relevant)
- Complete error message and stack trace
- Steps to reproduce

**For Feature Requests:**
- Clear description of the desired functionality
- Use case and motivation
- Proposed implementation approach (if you have ideas)

## Communication Channels

### Getting Help

- **GitHub Issues** - For bug reports and feature requests
- **GitHub Discussions** - For general questions and community discussions

### Contributing to Documentation

- Documentation source is in the `docs/` folder
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where appropriate
- Test all code examples

## Development Workflow

### Typical Contribution Flow

1. **Choose an Issue**
   - Look for issues labeled `good-first-issue` if you're new
   - Comment on the issue to indicate you're working on it

2. **Develop Your Solution**
   - Follow the development environment setup
   - Make small, focused commits
   - Write tests as you go

3. **Test Thoroughly**
   - Run the full test suite
   - Test with different input formats if relevant
   - Verify performance impact for large datasets

4. **Document Your Changes**
   - Update docstrings for modified functions
   - Update user documentation if needed
   - Add changelog entry for significant changes

## Code of Conduct

### Version Format: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

- **MAJOR** - Incremented for incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** - Incremented for backwards-compatible functionality additions
- **PATCH** - Incremented for backwards-compatible bug fixes

### Release Process

1. **Automated Versioning** - We use `python-semantic-release` for automated version bumping
2. **Commit Message Format** - Use conventional commits to trigger appropriate version bumps:
   ```
   feat: add new converter format (triggers MINOR)
   fix: resolve memory leak (triggers PATCH)
   feat!: redesign API structure (triggers MAJOR)
   ```

3. **Breaking Changes** - Always include `!` in commit type or `BREAKING CHANGE:` in footer
4. **Changelog** - Automatically generated from commit messages
