# Remaining Pydocstyle Violations

**Status**: 101 violations remaining (down from 205 - 51% improvement!)

## Summary

After running `docformatter` automated fixes, we've reduced pydocstyle violations by over half. The remaining violations are primarily cosmetic formatting issues and missing docstrings.

## Breakdown by Type

### D415 - First line should end with punctuation (34 violations)
**Severity**: Cosmetic
**Impact**: Low - doesn't affect functionality
**Fix**: Add period/question mark/exclamation to end of docstring first line

**Examples**:
```python
# Bad
def foo():
    """Do something cool"""

# Good
def foo():
    """Do something cool."""
```

### D205 - Blank line required between summary and description (34 violations)
**Severity**: Cosmetic
**Impact**: Low - doesn't affect functionality
**Fix**: Add blank line after summary line

**Examples**:
```python
# Bad
def foo():
    """Summary here.
    Detailed description here.
    """

# Good
def foo():
    """Summary here.

    Detailed description here.
    """
```

### D209 - Multi-line docstring closing quotes should be on separate line (14 violations)
**Severity**: Cosmetic
**Impact**: Low - doesn't affect functionality
**Fix**: Move closing quotes to own line

**Examples**:
```python
# Bad
def foo():
    """Summary here.

    Description here."""

# Good
def foo():
    """Summary here.

    Description here.
    """
```

### D417 - Missing argument descriptions in docstring (7 violations)
**Severity**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium - missing parameter documentation
**Fix**: Add Args section with parameter descriptions

**Examples**:
```python
# Bad
def foo(x, y):
    """Add two numbers."""
    return x + y

# Good
def foo(x, y):
    """Add two numbers.

    Args:
        x: First number
        y: Second number

    Returns:
        Sum of x and y
    """
    return x + y
```

### D107 - Missing docstring in __init__ (4 violations)
**Severity**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium - constructors should be documented
**Fix**: Add docstring to __init__ method

### D102 - Missing docstring in public method (4 violations)
**Severity**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium - public API should be documented
**Fix**: Add docstring to public method

### D103 - Missing docstring in public function (3 violations)
**Severity**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium - public API should be documented
**Fix**: Add docstring to public function

## Recommendation

**Priority 1 (Optional)**: Fix D417, D107, D102, D103 (18 violations)
These require manual work to write meaningful documentation for public APIs.

**Priority 2 (Low)**: Fix D415, D205, D209 (82 violations)
These are cosmetic formatting issues that don't affect functionality. Can be fixed with careful automation or ignored.

## Progress

- **Starting point**: 205 violations
- **After docformatter**: 101 violations
- **Improvement**: 51% reduction (104 violations fixed)
- **Remaining**: 101 violations (mostly cosmetic)

## Future Work

Consider adding `pydocstyle` to pre-commit hooks with configuration to:
1. Error on D417, D107, D102, D103 (missing docs)
2. Warn on D415, D205, D209 (formatting)
3. Auto-fix D415, D205, D209 in pre-commit

Or simply accept current state as "good enough" given 51% improvement.
