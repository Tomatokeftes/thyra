# Cleanup Summary - COO Optimization Project

## Files Created Today

### Keep These (Important)

1. **COO_OPTIMIZATION_NEXT_STEPS.md** - Your action plan for tomorrow
   - Step-by-step implementation guide
   - Estimated times for each task
   - Success criteria
   - ~2.5 hours total work

2. **BENCHMARK_RESULTS_2025-10-15.md** - Official benchmark results
   - Complete results and analysis
   - Evidence for why COO is better
   - Reference for future work

3. **benchmarks/sparse_matrix_construction_benchmark.py** - Full benchmark (modified)
   - Added progress bars with tqdm
   - Enhanced fallback progress display
   - Keep for future testing

4. **benchmarks/sparse_matrix_quick_test.py** - Quick test version (new)
   - 100k pixels instead of 1M
   - Runs in 4-6 minutes vs 40-60 minutes
   - Useful for quick validation

### Already Existed (Keep)

5. **BENCHMARK_QUICKSTART.md** - Instructions for running benchmarks
6. **benchmarks/README_SPARSE_BENCHMARK.md** - Detailed benchmark documentation
7. **benchmarks/install_deps_and_run.py** - Helper script for dependencies

## Files to Delete

**NONE** - All files are useful for reference or future work.

## Temporary Files (Already Ignored by Git)

These are fine to keep (handled by .gitignore):
- `__pycache__/` directories
- `*.pyc` files
- `benchmarks/results/*.json` (if generated)

## Summary of Changes

### Modified Files
```
M benchmarks/sparse_matrix_construction_benchmark.py
  - Added tqdm progress bars
  - Enhanced fallback progress (percentage, ETA)
  - Better tracking for long-running benchmarks
```

### New Files
```
?? COO_OPTIMIZATION_NEXT_STEPS.md
?? BENCHMARK_RESULTS_2025-10-15.md
?? CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md (this file)
?? benchmarks/sparse_matrix_quick_test.py
```

## What to Do Tomorrow

1. **Read**: COO_OPTIMIZATION_NEXT_STEPS.md
2. **Implement**: Follow the 8-step plan
3. **Reference**: Use BENCHMARK_RESULTS_2025-10-15.md for context

## Git Status

Current branch: `feature/coo-matrix-optimization`

Ready to commit:
- Progress bar improvements to benchmark
- Quick test script
- Documentation of results and next steps

Suggested commit message:
```
docs: add COO optimization benchmark results and implementation plan

Add comprehensive benchmark results showing COO is 1.28x faster and uses
65% less memory than LIL matrix approach. Include detailed next steps for
implementation.

Also add quick test script (100k pixels) and progress bars to benchmarks
for better tracking of long-running tests.

Results summary:
- COO: 492s, 5.92 GB (1.28x faster, 65% less memory)
- LIL: 632s, 16.98 GB (current approach, crashes at scale)

Ready to proceed with implementation.
```

## Files You Can Delete After Implementation

Once you've successfully implemented COO in production:
- CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md (this file - just a temporary guide)

Keep everything else as documentation and for regression testing.
